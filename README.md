# Rutherford_Simulation

This is a simulation of Rutherford sccatering with GEANT4.
To run simulation, please install GEANT4 from https://geant4.web.cern.ch. 

Rutherford scattering is an important experiment that determined the structure of the atom (a small nucleus in the center with electrons surrounding it).
This simulation follows suit, scattering alpha rays with a thin metal target in the center, which is detected by a detector placed around it.

Each of the three source codes here has a different target metal.
Furthermore, the simulation conditions are tailored to my experiments for my thesis, so be careful if you try this yourself.
